# My Step Count Analysis

## Description

DSA 210  2024-2025 Fall Term Project

## Motivation 
For many years I have tried to increase my activity and step count. So, I always wondered how I can increase my daily steps and  which factors affect it.
In my project I will dive deep in my personal data and find the most important factors that affect my steps and by determining these factors I will create new routines to increase my step count. The factors that I will take account will be:
* **Time Period**
  * Months
  * Seasons
  * Years  
* **Sleep Time**
* **Exam Dates**
* **Emotional State**
* **Weight**

## Plan
- [X] Data Collection
- [ ] Data Visualisation
- [ ] Data Analysis
- [ ] Findings

## Data Collection
I have collected my step data from samsung health and apple health because my new phone is samsung and my old phone was an iphone. I have manually written down my weight, emotional state and sleep time. I write down my emotional state as a number between 0 to 10 that correlates with how good I feel at the end of the day. Sleep Time is the hour that I decide to go sleep for that day. I have collected my exam dates from my past emails.

## Data Visualisation
After collecting my data, I am planning to plot graphs in order to understand data better and find outliers and correlations. I will also use these graphs to come up with interesting questions and hypothesis.

## Data Analysis
I will form and test my hypothesis. I will use statistical tests in order to test my hypothesis and according to the results I will form the findings part.

## Findings
I will evaluate the results of data analysis and decide which hypothesis are true which are not. After finding the factors that affects my step count I will use this information to guess my step count by using Machine Learning.
