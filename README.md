# My Step Count Analysis

## Description

DSA 210  2024-2025 Fall Term Project

## Motivation 
For many years I have tried to increase my activity and step count. So, I always wondered how I can increase my daily steps and  which factors affect it.
In my project I will dive deep in my personal data and find the most important factors that affect my steps and by determining these factors I will create new routines to increase my step count. The factors that I will take account will be:
* **Time Period**
  * Months
  * Seasons
  * Years  
* **Sleep**
* **Exams**
* **Emotional State**
* **Weight**
